I am making personal edit to this translator:
github.com/WileytheBANG/pokeking-translator 

link to my GitHub with all the files:
https://github.com/compscimmo/pokeking-translator.git

I copy and pasted the broswer-polyfill.min.js from here into my own file:

ðŸ”„ Update the Dictionary

Some Chinese text may remain in the output â€” this is non-essential and generally safe to ignore unless you stray from the intended solve.
