## üìù Interaction on page

### 1. View original/View translation:

Having the page load in Chinese will allow the built-in translation module to translate the confusing part of the solve. Moreover, veteran/creator prefer to look at the original text to fully understand what the solve says. In short, this interaction allows you to have more option when using this extension.

### 2. Translation error report:

You see a crucial part of the translation is missing, that you do not know what to do next? Here is the solution for you, introduce the "error report" button, that raise the flag for us dev to update it, so you will not encounter that situation again.
